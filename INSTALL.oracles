HOW TO CREATE A TLSNOTARY ORACLE EBS SNAPSHOT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change to Asia Pacific Singapore region.
Create a volume from snap-3eb0e00a (this is the snapshot used by Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (PV), SSD Volume Type - ami-e8f1c1ba).
Attach the volume to any running instance as e.g. /dev/sdf.
Optionally you may want to copy all files from the volume to a volume of smaller size (otherwise the resulting snapshot will be the default 8GB).

From within the instance:	
<bash>
  git clone https://github.com/tlsnotary/pagesigner-oracles
  cd pagesigner-oracles
  sudo -s
  mkdir /mnt/disk
  mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/disk
  DISK=/mnt/disk
  rm $DISK/etc/init.d/ssh
  rm $DISK/usr/sbin/sshd
  sed -i '136s/.*/ kernel          \/boot\/vmlinuz-3.13.0-48-generic root=\/dev\/xvda ro console=hvc0/' $DISK/boot/grub/menu.lst
  sed -i 's/- bootcmd//' $DISK/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
  sed -i 's/- runcmd//' $DISK/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
  sed -i 's/- rightscale_userdata//' $DISK/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
  sed -i 's/- scripts-user//' $DISK/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
  cp -R notary $DISK/root
  cp notary/rc.local $DISK/etc/rc.local
  chmod 755 $DISK/etc/rc.local && chown root:root $DISK/etc/rc.local
  cp -R signing_server $DISK/root
</bash>
	
	
"umount /dev/xvdf" and detach it in the AWS console.
Create a public snapshot from the volume and note the snapshot ID.

Create an AMI from the snapshot, making sure that:
Virtualization type is Paravirtual
Kernel ID is aki-503e7402
Root device name is /dev/xvda
Note the AMI ID and make the AMI public.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO LAUNCH AN ORACLE INSTANCE FROM THE PUBLIC SNAPSHOT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Launch the AMI you created from AWS management console. Choose "Proceed without a key pair".

Make sure that:
  Instance's "launchTime" and volume's "attachTime" happened on the same minute with no more than 3 seconds between the events.
  Console Output (right-click an instance ->Instance Settings -> Get System Log) is available, since it was observed that sometimes instance doesn't have any.
  
After the main server AMI started, copy main server pubkey from Console Log into pubkey.pem
Start the signing server with TCP port 10004 open and send it pubkey.pem: cat pubkey.pem | nc sigserverIP 10004
Make sure you hit the 20 sec window when the signing server is listening on that port, otherwise you'll get TCP RST.
Feed the sig server IP to main server: echo -n '1.2.3.4' | nc mainserverIP 10011


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW CAN YOU PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT A CERTAIN IP ADDRESS IS RUNNING THE ORACLE INSTANCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use aws_query.py to create and publish URLs for requests 
DescribeInstances
DescribeInstanceAttribute
DescribeVolumes
GetUser
GetConsoleOutput

FOR VERIFIERS: HOW TO CHECK THAT THE SNAPSHOT CONTENTS WAS NOT MALICIOUSLY MODIFIED.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Repeat all the steps described in "HOW TO CREATE AN ORACLE EBS SNAPSHOT" but don't create a public snapshot.
Attach the resulting volume (volX) to a running instance as /dev/sdg
Create a volume from the snapshot (volY) you are verifying and attach it to /dev/sdh
After that, run from within the instance
<bash>
  sudo -s
  mkdir /mnt/disk1
  mkdir /mnt/disk2
  mount /dev/xvdg /mnt/disk1
  mount /dev/xvdh /mnt/disk2
</bash>
 
Compare the hashes of volX and volY. 
First hash file/directory/symlink paths, ownership, permissions, and symlink targets.
Then hash the contents of all regular files.
The outputs must match.
<bash>
  cd /mnt/disk1
  find . -printf '%h %f %U %G %m %l\n' | sort -t \n | sha256sum
  find . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum

  cd /mnt/disk2
  find . -printf '%h %f %U %G %m %l\n' | sort -t \n | sha256sum
  find . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum
</bash>

FOR VERIFIERS: HOW TO DETERMINE THAT THE RUNNING ORACLE INSTANCE IS LEGIT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The published URLs must conform to the checks performed in functions starting with check* in content/oracles.js.

POSSIBLE ATTACKS AND HOW THEY WILL BE MITIGATED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(or in other words, what prevents the AWS account owner from modifying the oracle instance code)


Attack1.
Launch the AMI with rogue snapshot on /dev/sda1
Mitigation:
AWS doesn't allow replacing the snapshotID on root device.


Attack2.
Launch the AMI with a rogue snapshot on /dev/sda2 hoping that AMI will boot it instead of /dev/sda1.
Mitgation:
When creating AMI, we changed the root device to /dev/xvda. We also changed a line in grub's menu.lst to pass root=/dev/xvda1 to kernel. Whereas before the kernel searched for a specific ext2label, now there is no wiggle room for the attacker.


Attack3.
Launch the AMI with /dev/sda1=none and a rogue snapshot on /dev/sda2. The AMI in absence of /dev/sda1 will boot /dev/sda2.
Attach the oracle snapshotID to /dev/sda1 and modify it. Then detach /dev/sda2 and reboot.
Upon reboot /dev/sda1 will be chosen by the kernel as the root device.
Mitigation:
The attachment time of /dev/sda1 will differ from the time when AMI was started. This is a red flag.

Attack4.
Launch AMI with user data passed in.
Mitigation:
AWS doesn't allow to modify user data while the instance is running, so DescribeInstanceAttribute userData API call will reveal that data was passed.
On top of that, we removed the bootcmd module from AMI's cloud-init. This module is responsible for handling the user Data.
